In alignment to the [TraceContext](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) specification, this section uses the
Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of [RFC5234](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#bib-rfc5234),
including the DIGIT rule in that document.

When setting [TraceState](api.md#tracestate) values that are part of the OTel ecosystem,
they MUST all be contained in a single entry using the `ot` key, with the value being
a semicolon separated list of key-value pairs such as:

* `ot=p:8;r:62`
* `ot=foo:bar;k1:13`

The [TraceContext](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) specification defines support for multiple "tenants" each to use their own `tracestate` entry by prefixing `tenant@` to tenant-specific values in a mixed tracing environment. OpenTelemetry recognizes this syntax but does not specify an interpretation for multi-tenant `tracestate`.
The list can be formally defined as:

```
list        = list-member *( ";" list-member )
list-member = key ":" value
```

The complete list length MUST NOT exceed 256 characters, as defined by the
[TraceState value section](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#value),
and the used keys MUST be unique.

Instrumentation libraries and clients MUST NOT use this entry, and they MUST
instead use their own entry.

## Key

The key is an identifier that describes an OTel concern.
Simple examples are `p`, `ts`, or `s1`.

The key can be formally defined as:

```
key        = lcalpha *(lcalpha / DIGIT )
lcalpha    = %x61-7A ; a-z
```

Specific keys used by OTel concerns MUST be defined as part of the Specification,
and hence it is forbidden to use any key that has not been defined in
the Specification itself.

## Value

The value is an opaque string. Although it has no maximum allowed length,
it is recommended to use short values, as the **entire** list of key-values
MUST NOT exceed 256 characters.

The value can be formally defined as:

```
value      = *(chr)
chr        = ucalpha / lcalpha / DIGIT / "." / "_" / "-"
ucalpha    = %x41-5A ; A-Z
lcalpha    = %x61-7A ; a-z
```

## Setting values

Set values MUST be either updated or added to the `ot` entry in `TraceState`,
in order to preserve existing values belonging to other OTel concerns. For example,
if a given concern K wants to set `k1:13`:

* `ot=p:8;r:62` will become `ot=p:8;r:62;k1:13`.
* `ot=p:8;k1:7;r:62` will become `ot=p:8;r:62;k1:13`. Preserving the order is not required.

If setting a value ends up making the entire `ot` entry exceed the 256 characters limit,
SDKs are advised to abort the operation and signal the user about the error, e.g.

```go
traceState, ok := SetTraceStateValue(traceState, value)
if ok {
  // Successfully set the specified value, traceState was updated.
} else {
  // traceState was not updated.
}
```

## Pre-defined OpenTelemetry sub-keys

The following values have been defined by OpenTelemetry.

### Sampling threshold value `th`

The OpenTelemetry TraceState `th` sub-key defines a sampling
threshold, which conveys effective sampling probability.  Valid values
of the `th` sub-fields include between 1 and 14 hexadecimal digits.

```
hexdigit = DIGIT ; A-F ; a-f
```

To decode the threshold from the OpenTelemetry TraceState `th` value,
first extend the value with trailing zeros to make 14 digits.  Then,
parse the 14-digit value as a 56-bit unsigned number, yielding a
rejection threshold.

OpenTelemetry defines consistent sampling in terms of a 56-bit trace
randomness value compared with the 56-bit rejection threshold.  When
the randomness value is less than the rejection threshold, the trace
is not sampled.

The threshold value `0` indicates that no traces are being rejected,
corresponding with 100% sampling.  For example, the following
TraceState value identifies a trace with 100% sampling:

```
tracestate: ot=th:0
```

In sampling, the term _adjusted count_ refers to the effective number
of items represented by a sampled item of telemetry.  To calculate
sampling probability from the rejection threshold, define a constant
`MaxAdjustedCount` equal to 2^56, the number of distinct 56-bit
values.  The sampling probability is defined:

```
Probability = (MaxAdjustedCount - Threshold) / MaxAdjustedCount
```

The adjusted count of a span is the inverse of its sampling
probability, which is derived from the rejection threshold:

```
AdjustedCount = MaxAdjustedCount / (MaxAdjustedCount - Threshold)
```
